      <p class="about-text">
        Dragons are pretty unique, they all have different colors, sizes ,and abilities.
        Some are different, almost like pokemon!
        For example, one could be a fire breathing dragon, a poison claw dragon
        or one could be a friend, like Toothless!
        For some facts, dragons have rough skin, horns, and sometimes live in dark places like a cave.
        They are often depicted as powerful, winged, and fire-breathing beasts.
        They can be large and intelligent, and their ability to fly and breathe.
        Dragons also vary in appearance, with different cultures having their own unique interpretations of the creature.
